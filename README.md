## TimeAdapt

TimeAdapt makes (i.e. will eventually make) a joint inference of demography and selection from longitudinal population genomic data. The inference is based on approximate Bayesian computation via random forest. It takes whole genome data and information about the ages of samples to perform simulations (using SLiM + pyslim/msprime).

### Requirements

The code has been tested with the following versions (on Ubuntu 20.04):

- Python 3.8.10
  - scikit-allel 1.3.2
  - msprime 1.0.1
  - numpy 1.20.3
  - pyslim 0.403
  - scipy 1.5.4
  - pytest 6.2.4
  - pandas 1.2.4
- R 3.6.3
  - ini 0.3.1
  - extraDistr 1.8.11
  - rcarbon 1.2.0
  - testthat 2.1.1
- SLiM 3.6

### Usage

These instructions are written for myself and might need to be adapted to other configurations.

Creation of the environment from scratch:
```shell
conda create -n timeadapt python==3.8.10 r-base=3.6.3
conda activate timeadapt
conda install scikit-allel
pip install msprime
conda install pyslim
conda install pytest
conda install -c r r-rcarbon
conda install -c r r-ini
conda install -c r r-extraDistr
conda install -c r r-testthat
conda env export > timeadapt.yml
```

Creation of the environment via yml file:
```shell
conda env create -f timeadapt.yml
```

Run (using snakemake) tests (testthat for R, pytest for Python)
```shell
conda activate timeadapt
snakemake test
```

Run one batch of simulations with Snakefile and get directed acyclic graph of pipeline
```shell
conda activate timeadapt
snakemake sim
snakemake --dag | dot -Tsvg > results/workflow_dag.svg
```

Alternatively you can create your own pipeline. For simulations, simulations.R generates files slim_\*.sh and pyslim_\*.sh with the SLiM and Python command lines that produce each simulation (SLiM must be run first, then Python).

Remove *all* results from project folder
```shell
snakemake clean_all
```

### Input files

- *Sample information file*: Text file with information on the samples to be analysed. First line should be a header containing the following column names:
   - "sampleID": String identifying each individual. Do not use spaces or tabs.
   - "age14C": Point estimate of age from radiocarbon dating (for ancient samples, set NA for modern samples or samples with a known calendar year). It indicates time of death.
   - "age14Cerror": Error for age from radiocarbon dating.
   - "year": Calendar year for the time of sampling (for present and modern samples, such as museum/collection samples, set NA for ancient samples)
   - "coverage": Numeric value indicating sequencing depth (do NOT add "x", write "30" not "30x")
   - "damageRepair": Indicate whather the library for ancient samples used a damage repair step. Indicate TRUE or FALSE (indicate TRUE for modern samples)
   - "groups": Numerical code to indicate the groups of individuals for which summary statistics will be calculated. For each digit, individuals with the same number form one group, each digit defines a set of groups. Summary statistics comparing groups (such as Fst). Numbers indicating groups must be consecutive and start with 0.

### How to cite TimeAdapt

TimeAdapt implements the method described by Pavinato et al. (2020). The code puts together several tools that should be acknowledged when using TimeAdapt: SLiM, pyslim, msprime (TODO: add full citation for these)
